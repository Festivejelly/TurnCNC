# TurnCNC
Modern CNC controller for lathes with automatic backlash compensation, tool library management, threading, and comprehensive G-code support.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by and incorporates concepts from the excellent [NanoELS](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels) by [@kachurovskiy](https://github.com/kachurovskiy). 

Key enhancements include:
* Multi-tool support with offset management
* Enhanced G-code compatibility (G10, G33 threading, G92, etc.)
* Tool management system
* Automatic backlash compensation
* Focus on CNC operation vs. traditional ELS

Huge thanks to the original author for creating such a solid foundation!
