# TurnCNC

Modern CNC controller for lathes with automatic backlash compensation, tool library management, threading, and comprehensive G-code support.

## Based on NanoELS

This project is a fork of the excellent [NanoELS](https://github.com/kachurovskiy/nanoels) by [kachurovskiy](https://github.com/kachurovskiy). We've extended it with:

- Multi-tool support with offset management  
- Enhanced G-code compatibility (G10, G33 threading, G92, etc.)
- Tool management system
- Focus on CNC operation vs. traditional ELS

Huge thanks to the original author for creating such a solid foundation!
